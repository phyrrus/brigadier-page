          Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows Brigadier to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

          If we require more time (up to 90 days), Brigadier will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
          Any disclosures Brigadier provides will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.
          The response Brigadier provides will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. 
          For data portability requests, Brigadier will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and 
          should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
          Brigadier does not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

          completing your request.
