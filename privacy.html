the right to object (we have never performed any data science projects on user data and do not anticipate doing so in the future. If, at some point in the future we determine a use for any sort of data science project on our user data, we will notify you in writing before doing so. 
In that event you may remove your contact data from any such project by emailing us at support@brigadier.club with the subject line “Opt Out of Data Science”); 

right to access and rectification: You can contact us at support@brigadier.club at any time to access copies of all user data we retain for you. We will remove, update, or change any personal information about you from our servers immediately upon your request.

right of portability: We only retain your name and email address. Nevertheless, we will provide that information to you upon your request.

right of restriction: You can make a request for restriction or suppression of your personal data through the contact information at the end of this privacy policy.

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, if located in the European Union, you shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.

In addition to the above, an “unsubscribe” option is automatically included in the footer of every newsletter sent from the Stratechery. This allows you to easily unsubscribe from the newsletter. In the event you unsubscribe, we will immediately stop sending you the newsletter. Please note that unsubscribing from the newsletter with the newsletter’s “unsubscribe” button does not cancel your account with Stratechery LLC. In order to do so, please log in at Stratechery.com and cancel your account.

Stratechery will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your GDPR, CCPA, or other consumer privacy rights. Unless permitted by law, Stratechery will not:

Deny you goods or services.

Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, the nature of the services provided by Stratechery, a membership website, newsletter, and podcast feed, will require basic information including an active account and your email address in order for Stratechery to provide its services. Should you opt out entirely, Stratechery will be unable to provide you any of its services.


You have the right to request that Stratechery disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

The categories of personal information Stratechery collected about you.
The categories of sources for the personal information Stratechery collected about you.
Stratechery’s business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
The categories of third parties with whom Stratechery shares that personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information Stratechery collected about you (also called a data portability request).
If Stratechery sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:

disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion Request Rights

You have the right to request that Stratechery delete any of your personal information that Stratechery collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once Stratechery receives and confirms your verifiable consumer request, Stratechery will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information, unless an exception applies.

Stratechery may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for Stratechery or its service provider(s) to:

Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

Calling Stratechery at +1 (714) 202-6571, or
Sending a letter to us at Stratechery, LLC at 2093 Philadelphia Pike #9930, Claymont, Delaware, 19703, USA
Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows Stratechery to reasonably verify you are the person about whom Stratechery collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows Stratechery to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Stratechery cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if Stratechery cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with Stratechery. Stratechery will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format

Stratechery endeavors to respond to a verifiable consumer request within thirty (30) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), Stratechery will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

If you have an account with Stratechery, Stratechery will deliver its written response to that account. If you do not have an account with Stratechery, Stratechery will deliver its written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures Stratechery provides will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response Stratechery provides will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, Stratechery will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

Stratechery does not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If Stratechery determine that the request warrants a fee, Stratechery will tell you why it made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Stratechery may update this privacy policy by posting a new version on this website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are familiar with any changes.
